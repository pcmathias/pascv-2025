# Analysis for Pan American Society for Clinical Virology 2025 Meeting

Think of this repository as a folder containing files. In the box above you can click on a file to see the contents and if you'd like to download the file, click the button with three dots on the top left, then select "Download." This repository includes a Quarto document (pascv_analysis.qmd) that summarizes a data analysis resulting from an iterative series of prompts and responses with a generative AI model. Data analysis scripts in the R programming language were generated with support from ChatGPT-4o. The raw data are not included in this repository because the limited data set that was extracted includes data that are not direct identifiers but still fall within the definition of protected health information. However, some additional information regarding the input data are included in the Quarto document if you would like to try to execute it with your own data. A completed analysis is included in the pascv_analysis.html file to show the output - download this and then click on it to open it in your web browser.

## How do I get started with learning R?

- First you will need to install R and RStudio on your computer. Follow the instructions on the [Posit website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
- There are helpful resources for getting started [here](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/).
- [R For Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a great free textbook resource for learning R.
- Online courses can also be a valuable tool. Coursera has a [course series focused on data science and R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r#courses).
- There are a variety of general resources but learning in a lab medicine context can sometimes provide clearer examples and more relatable use cases for learning the language. Multiple professional conferences offer regular or intermittent workshops focused on teaching basic data analysis skills. Review upcoming agendas for these meetings to see if there may be an opportunity:
  - [Mass Spectrometry & Advances in the Clinical Lab](https://www.msacl.org/) offers data science courses in the longest format workshops (typically 8-16 hour workshops)
  - [Association for Diagnostics & Laboratory Medicine](https://myadlm.org/) has included data science development as part of its strategic plan and is currently developing a certificate program for foundational knowledge in the field
  - [Association for Pathology Informatics](https://www.pathologyinformatics.org/) periodically hosts an introductory workshop virtually or at its annual meeting
  - The [American Society for Clinical Pathology](https://www.ascp.org) meeting will include a short introductory workshop this year
